Activation_plot is for question1
problem 3 and problem3_tensorflow is for question 3. I use two different way.
softmax_classify.py and gradient descent.py is for question 4. At the begging, I use tensorflow, but I don't know how to continues. So I just use numpy to solve (3), because i find some paper about it...
testslides is for testing the example in slides to get the probability.

Thanks
